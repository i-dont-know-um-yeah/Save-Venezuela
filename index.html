    <p> Venezuela, years ago aprox (1970) was the richest country in latin america and one of the top 20 worldwide, it was a paradise and no one ever wanted to leave , the pasport used to be strong and people all over the world came to venezuela especialy during and post world war two such as : Italians , Lebanese , Portugese , Greeks , Poland and so many more. Even the people rarely immigrated as the land was a utopia flooding with abundant resources such as : oil and petrolium in the largest reserves,gold, diamonds and so much more. However in 1999-2013 ,  Hugo Chávez the former president of Venezuela was elected and this lead to the major downfall of venezuela. He championed the "bolivian revoulution " that was a socialist / communist regime however this did <B>INITIALY</B> help with poverty rates this was with strict price controls , currency controls , pure oil dependance . The pure oil dependance made the fundings for any social program to reduce poverty  unstable and heavy couruption ment that they were ineffective. This lead to state dependency rather than long term growth. Courruption also skyrocketed because governance weakened due to state institutions becoming politicised. He erased democracy as a whole. In 1999 he also made a new consitiution that lead to the effects I previously mentioned allowing for more enabling laws, longer terms + re-election and restructurisation of the jury, electorial bodies and the legislature. The power was centeralised in Caracas because of this reducing local goverment autonomy and lead to his authoritarian style untill he died and told Maduro (his literal <b> DRIVER</b>) to become the next president  </p>
